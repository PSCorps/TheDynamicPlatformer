This is the Readme.txt file.
This a repository made for the Google Code-In and It contains a Game created by me called The Dynamic Platformer. The game is being made by Unity 5 in C# and it is a 2d game which is going to be released for android, windows, mac and hopefully for ios.

This is basically for a task in Google Code-in but I believe its my best opportunity to put my game up on github so that I can get some help from other people who know about the unity engine better than me and can help me to make this game better.

It is yet not complete and only one level is completely designed, I hope I can get some help from people all around the world. :)
